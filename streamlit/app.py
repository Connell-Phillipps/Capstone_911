#### **Insights:**
* Reducing response time leads to increased public opinion of police
    * Increasing public opinion of police builds a stronger community by increasing trust and outlook of police
    * When people trust and have a better opinion of the police they are more likely to report incidents
    * When police respond faster they have a greater change to defuse situations and decrease threats
* Reducing response times wouldn't really reduce response times for critical crime in progress calls, police already respond as fast as possible to those calls.
* There is a chance that using this model to more strategic place officers might reduce response time for a critical call and save lives.
